# Simple Shop App Test (React + Redux + Redux Saga + Express + MongoDB)

## Project is still in development

**Storytelling :**
bioFood is a (fake obviously) online shop which sells short food circuits products which are only available through the shop.

### The stack

The project uses in front ***react/redux/redux-thunk*** (for middleware), and ***express/mongoDB*** for back and database.

The project was created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [express-generator](https://expressjs.com/fr/starter/generator.html)

## Steps for starting

### `git clone`

For starting this project, better thing to do is ***clone this repository*** to your computer directly and ***start the server and front*** from ***client*** folder directly.

See below the cli commands for starting each ones.

### `npm i`

Next step is to download with this command, the necessary files to run the project.

***You can run the server and the front directly from the client folder*** </br>
(so there's no need to run separately the server and the front from each folders, high five :raised_hand:)

### `npm start or yarn start`

The front is the same as in ***create-react-app***, go check the cli commands here is needed :</br>[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
